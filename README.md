Dimension,Level 1 – Initial,Level 2 – Emerging,Level 3 – Defined,Level 4 – Advanced,Level 5 – Optimized
Event Design & Contracts,"Ad hoc events; no schema; inconsistent naming","Basic events; limited structure; breaking changes common","Domain events defined; schemas documented; basic versioning","Contract-first design; schema registry; backward-compatible evolution","Events treated as products; catalogued; reusable across domains"
Choreography vs Orchestration,"Hidden orchestration; RPC disguised as events","Mixed patterns; tight coupling remains","Intentional choreography; orchestration only where needed","Domain-aligned event flows; sagas well understood","Event flows modeled explicitly; impact analysis and governance in place"
Infrastructure & Delivery Guarantees,"Best-effort delivery; no DLQ; unclear semantics","Basic retries; some DLQ; manual recovery","Standardized delivery semantics; idempotency patterns","Automated replay; back-pressure handling; IaC for topics","Failure modes tested; chaos scenarios; resilient by design"
Decoupling & Domain Alignment,"Events expose internal models; producer knows consumers","Partial decoupling; cross-domain leakage","Domain-aligned events; consumers depend on contracts","Clear bounded contexts; anti-corruption layers","Evolution-friendly; new consumers onboard without producer changes"
Observability & Operability,"No visibility; debugging via logs only","Basic logs/metrics; limited correlation","Correlation IDs; traces across services; dashboards","Business-level visibility; event trails for transactions","Replay, inspect, simulate events; anomaly detection; SLOs for flows"
Data Ownership & Consistency,"Shared DBs; events as side-effects","Partial ownership; sync dependencies remain","Event-sourced thinking; async propagation for reads","Clear ownership; eventual consistency managed intentionally","Consistency patterns mature; reconciliation, compaction, ordering handled"
Security & Governance,"Minimal controls; broad topic access","Basic auth; secrets scattered","Role-based access; secrets in vault; PII minimized","Federated governance; classification applied; access workflow","Zero Trust; lineage & auditability; purpose-based access"
